Learning Python
===============

Beginner
--------

Learn Python Interactive Tutorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Learnpython.org is an easy non-intimidating way to get introduced to Python.
The website takes the same approach used on the popular `Try Ruby <http://tryruby.org/>`_
website, it has an interactive Python interpreter built into the site that
allows you to go through the lessons without having to install Python locally.

    `Learn Python <http://www.learnpython.org/>`_


If you want a more traditional book, *Python For You and Me* is an
excellent resource for learning all aspects of the language.

    `Python for You and Me <http://pymbook.readthedocs.org/>`_


Learn Python the Hard Way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an excellent beginner programmer's guide to Python. It covers "hello
world" from the console to the web.

    `Learn Python the Hard Way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>`_


Crash into Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also known as *Python for Programmers with 3 Hours*, this guide gives
experienced developers from other languages a crash course on Python.

Dive Into Python 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dive Into Python 3 is a good book for those ready to jump in to Python 3. It's
a good read if you are moving from Python 2 to 3 or if you already have some
experience programming in another language.

Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Think Python attempts to give an introduction to basic concepts in computer
science through the use of the Python language. The focus was to create a book
with plenty of exercises, minimal jargon and a section in each chapter devoted
to the subject of debugging.

While exploring the various features available in the Python language the
author weaves in various design patterns and best practices.

The book also includes several case studies which have the reader explore the
topics discussed in the book in greater detail by applying those topics to
real-world examples. Case studies include assignments in GUI and Markov
Analysis.

Python Koans
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python Koans is a port of Edgecase's Ruby Koans.  It uses a test-driven
approach, q.v. TEST DRIVEN DESIGN SECTION to provide an interactive tutorial
teaching basic Python concepts.  By fixing assertion statements that fail in a
test script, this provides sequential steps to learning Python.

For those used to languages and figuring out puzzles on their own, this can be
a fun, attractive option. For those new to Python and programming, having an
additional resource or reference will be helpful.

A Byte of Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A free introductory book that teaches Python at the beginner level, it assumes no
previous programming experience.

    `A Byte of Python for Python 3.x <http://swaroopch.com/notes/Python_en-Preface/>`_


Advanced
--------

Pro Python
~~~~~~~~~~

This book is for intermediate to advanced Python programmers who are looking to understand how
and why Python works the way it does and how they can take their code to the next level.

Expert Python Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Expert Python Programming deals with best practices in programming Python and
is focused on the more advanced crowd.

It starts with topics like decorators (with caching, proxy, and context manager
case-studies), method resolution order, using super() and meta-programming, and
general :pep:`8` best practices.

It has a detailed, multi-chapter case study on writing and releasing a package
and eventually an application, including a chapter on using zc.buildout.  Later
chapters detail best practices with writing documentation, test-driven
development, version control, and optimization/profiling.

The Python Tutorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the official tutorial, it covers all the basics, and offers a tour of the
language and the standard library, recommended for those who need a quickstart
guide to the language.

For Engineers and Scientists
----------------------------

A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python, written by Hans Petter Langtangen,
mainly covers Python's usage in scientific field. In the book, examples are
chosen from mathematics and the natural sciences.
